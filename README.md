# Whisper Audio Transcription API (RunPod + Hugging Face)

This project is a serverless audio transcription API built for [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io), using a fine-tuned model from Hugging Face. It accepts audio input (as base64 or file path), transcribes it to text, and returns the transcription as a base64-encoded `.docx` Word document.
